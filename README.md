# LetJavaCrash

## Goal
Can you write some code to let JVM crash? The crash may include:
* Different kinds of OOM: OOM Heap, OOM Metaspace.
* StackOverFlow.
* JVM Core Dump.
* GC errors: GC overhead limit exceeded.
* Other errors.


## Basics

JVM's limit or OS limit:

1. It is impossible to make an array with length 2^64
2. Stack size
